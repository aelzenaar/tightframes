=============

A collection of utilities to generate spherical (_t_,_t_)-designs in **C**^d with given parameters.

Requirements
------------

  * MATLAB (at least R2018b) with the Statistics toolbox

For the Python HTML generation utility, you also need:
  * Python 3._x_, where _x_ is a version [supported](https://au.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/system-requirements-for-matlab-engine-for-python.html) by
    the [MATLAB API for Python](https://au.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab-engine-for-python.html)  (for Python utility only).
  * The MATLAB API for Python itself ([installation instructions](https://au.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html)). This comes with MATLAB,
    it just needs to be manually enabled.
